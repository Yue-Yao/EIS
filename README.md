# Studienarbeit  

The code is about the student research project: Data preprocessing and database building for all-solid-state battery tests: a preparation for data-driven modeling

In the project a database is established to store the battery test data. Then the data are analyzed and processed.

To run the code, first put all raw data in .mpr file into the folders 'raw_data/form' and 'raw_data/cycle'. Then change the connection setting in Dataset_EIS.ipynb.
