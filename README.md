#EIS  

The code here can separate different information from the given data, which is messy.
The splitted data will be loaded in MySQL and some corresponding tables will be created.

To run the code, first put all raw data in .mpr file into folder 'raw_data'. Then change the connection setting in Dataset_EIS.ipynb.
